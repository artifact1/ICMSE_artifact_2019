Why no backward compatibility to iOS 6?,
I think it is a huge mistake to do so.,

"This single app has replaced my GTD apps, note apps, outliners, presentation apps, file sharing, and with the sync is available everywhere I need.",
Great to have my stuff available in one place.,
Reason for only 4 stars is because some features are not available across all platforms.,complaint
The app seemingly does not support cut and paste after IOS7 upgrade.,
"\n\nI  d give 5 stars, but Evernote really need to give feature parity with their desktop version.",request
It used to allow adding multiple tags at once.,
Just clip all thoughts you have from any medium to the software and it is recall able.,

Whether you want to organize your butterfly collection or organize your dissertation Evernote can help you do it.,
As of Dec upgrade it still crashes.,complaint
It has become something I rely on but it crashes on my iPhone.,complaint
I tried opening it from the App Store but it wouldn  t let me.,complaint
This app alone is the first one I recommend to any family member or friend with a new iOS (or other) device.,

I sure wish there was a better app than Evernote for this feature set because it has so many bugs and feature limitations.,complaint-request
Also wish there was a way to view all notes in Flipboard and to display alerts for random notes!,request
I don  t need any other note taking apps to store my notes.,
"Every time I have something come up with in my mind, I just simply take a draft in Evernote and tag it as idea"".""",
It crashes constantly.,complaint
"When I update a note on my PC it takes forever to show up after I sync on phone, sometimes I even have to log out and back for it to show up.",complaint
"So because of this program, I updated my iOS, and it changed its look completely and its stability.",
It crashes every time within 2 minutes of using it.,complaint

"It would be nice to have a word counter feature though ,",request
"If you are looking for an app to keep all your information:from pictures to web links,quotes,recipes,etc.This is the ultimate app,look no more!",

"I currently cannot attach photos without it crashing, so I may have to find a replacement soon.",complaint
"Just installed it on a new iPad; I  m glad I don  t have too much invested in it, because I  m abandoning it over the font size issue.",

"s problems with this app , 5,  ptcgkm ,  This is a great app, which I have been using for many years.",
"I tried fixing it myself before contacting support, but I made the problem worse.",complaint
\n\nI recommend Evernote to everyone I meet.,
Since the new update the app crashes a lot on my 4s   especially when I try to take a photo in the app.,complaint
"Start crashing : ( ,",complaint
"But since IOS7, it crashes and freezes on a website at least once a week.",complaint
"The only way I can continue is to go through iTunes to delete the whole app, then reinstall it.",
Love the ease with which other apps can integrate with Evernote.,
"It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words.",complaint
"Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7.",
The problems I  ve experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting.,
"I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand by, and looking for possible alternatives.",
"Yodaman70 ,  Not sure if this is an Evernote or iTunes issues but found this app and two others aren  t upgradeable yet 60 other apps no problem.",complaint
"It  s time for Evernote to take a good, hard look at its software and start pulling features.",request
Still crashes a lot when capturing and attaching photos to the note.,complaint
"This app is ok, but we need to get these machines to be more than places to brain dump.",request
"And, each time a sync error occurs, the error report transmission fails as well.",complaint
I would use it exclusively if it had spreadsheet editing capabilities.,request
"Had been five for me, but the update one previous to this broke it for whole tribes of us, and it took them a week to get the fix out (see below).",complaint
How do these things get out of the gate?,

"Works fine, I have had no issues.",
This app needs an update.,request
Don  t listen to anybody who gave them one star they are just mad because they didn  t get any followers.,
The way I think is to categorize first and then comment...but once you select a category you  ve pinned it and then you must do the several step process of editing.,
It helps me keep track of my pins and makes the easy to find when I need them.,
"When I try to pin from Facebook, half the time it tells me I need to log in first.",
So sometimes I just skip it and email the item to myself.,
"I was nvr a big Facebook fan bc it gave too much personal without any personality   Pinterest let  s your real self shine through whether you intended to or not ;)\nI just wish that with the update that they would fix the crashing of my iPad if I have too many windows open or I have left it open too long :( ,",request
