Songs just speed up instead of offering any unique difficulty to tile layouts. The game doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment because there is no completing a certain difficulty, it can always go faster and you will eventually miss a single note. If you are looking to install this game to introduce yourself to rhythm gaming, please skip it. There is a lot more to offer in the genre than this piano tile experience.</td>

<td>Very enjoyable! I like it way better than Piano Tiles 2 (which is more of a classic, monotonous style). This game excels in offering music with dynamic styles (e.g. band, guitar). Keep it up!

<td>I've been following the whole piano tile craze for a while, and these ones I've enjoyed the most.  Although this app is kind of a bummer for me as a musician and comparing it to piano tiles 2.  No matter how low on the screen I tap the tiles while playing, the music is always lagging, at least 2 beats behind where I'm even able to play at.  If I were to play at the music's speed, I'd lose because the tiles for the notes and chords would pass the bottom of the screen because of the audio lag.  All around, that kind of ruins the experience for me - as the graphics and smooth transitions from song book to piano are amazing, and has a similar classic piano tiles 2 background but I still cannot fully enjoy this game simply because of the audio lag.  I'm going to take my best guess as to why the audio lag is an issue in this app, as you [the makers] are simply putting the song over the gameplay instead of programming notes and chords to play when a tile is <mark>tapped.  Now, I don't recall</mark> having this issue in any of the past apps, but it's certainly a turn off and leads me away from your piano tiles applications.  Thank you.</td>

Second, on some songs the sound is not up to the beat, as for example in the beginners challenge it is way off and i solidly go off of my vision.
