<td><mark>Awesome doesn't begin to describe this game. It is mind-blowing. Without a doubt the best put together black tiles game out there. It took me a little bit to get to like the new graphics because</mark> I learned on the old one. But I have definitely accepted them and really love the colors they are truly beautiful to see. Come see why millions of people all over the world love this game. Enjoy yourself while you challenge other players from all over the world and meet new friends along the way. That is probably one of its best features. But you also have Lively upbeat music. Beautiful arranged scores in the highest quality piano + instrumental music of any game like this. This game is very well-thought-out. Very well-planned and very well orchestrated. It's a joy to play. I can't think of any other game I like playing more. I honestly can say without a doubt I love this game and I know I'm not alone. So come on be apart of something truly wonderful to learn to play. You will get lost in the music and spend hours learning just like I did and loving every minute. How do you give 10 Stars when there are only 5? You guys deserve it. Way to go.</td>

<td>The game could be good unfortunately due to the fact that the developers operate their ad Revenue like an AIDS Factory it's almost impossible to <mark>play</mark> the game. In addition to the game having advertisements display in the middle of a game costing you a life a lot of the advertisements take you to random web pages that tell you your phone is infected.  If the developer such as this does not know how to properly use ads and know to wean out and Screen those who potentially place viruses on people's phones then this game should be avoided at all cost do not install this game it is the equivalent of waking up and sleeping with a prostitute asking for AIDS</td>

<td><mark>Don't know why this could be considered a rhythm game. The music does not line up with the tiles very well, yet the tiles are so large that it barely matters when you hit them. Songs just speed up instead of offering any unique difficulty to tile layouts. The game doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment because</mark> there is no completing a certain difficulty, it can always go faster and you will eventually miss a single note. If you are looking to install this game to introduce yourself to rhythm gaming, please skip it. There is a lot more to offer in the genre than this piano tile experience.</td>

<td>The music must be within the tiles. If you tap it, the music is within it to make it fully alive. It's kind of useless if you tap it with just having a background sound. Kind of boring. And the data of each song unlocked is not yet downloaded. Must have an internet connection to download. Can you just put those data once? Even though its size is huge atleast all songs were ready when <mark>bought</mark>/unlocked. By the way, I love the songs. Can't resist from it. I hope this suggestion will help your app improves a lot.</td>

<td>It is fun BUT the game is not sensitive enough when I tap sometimes it does not respond I don't have this problem with piano tiles <mark>two</mark> or something And sometimes when we are battling or something the tiles suddenly stop for a split second and when it starts again I missed the tiles already and I lose even though I have the chance of winning  This is the only game I gave three stars to so please fix it  The good thing about this game is that this game as it has a very unique feature of a multi player mode and I like it. It makes it more interesting(only that the perfect line is too low) it is also very convenient that the hearts refill very fast. Thank you for these features.</td>

<td>Very enjoyable! I like it way better than Piano Tiles 2 (which is more of a classic, monotonous style). This game excels in offering music with dynamic styles (e.g. band, guitar). Keep it up! Keep making great music! The only thing that bothers me is the abrupt ending with audience applause everytime I <mark>finish</mark> a song and some lags when I hit a tile beyond the line. I hope you fix it soon. Nevertheless, I love this game! Also I think this games requires a powerful device to truly enjoy it.</td>

<td>The game is good overall but I have a few issues with this game. Firstly, the registration input in this game is not good. Half of my tap isn't being registered and makes the game really frustrating. Also, I am not sure if it was intentional but when <mark>playing</mark> the game it, the frame rate would go down hence I can't get the rhythm down. All in all I love this game but these few issues are hindering it.</td>

<td><mark>Overall the game is meh. The background is cancerous to the eyes, it hurts to look at for too long. The detection system is inaccurate, but not to the point of absolute trash, but still</mark> very frustrating. When you tapped the notes, it didn't feel in sync with the music playing in the background which is crucial because the notes are supposed to come put according to the music and if it doesn't the chances of messing up increases by quite a bit (at least for me). Basically I'm saying that the idea is ok/subpar, but the execution was terrible</td>

<td>I've been following the whole piano tile craze for a while, and these ones I've enjoyed the most.  Although this app is kind of a bummer for me as a musician and comparing it to piano tiles 2.  No matter how low on the screen I tap the tiles while <mark>playing</mark>, the music is always lagging, at least 2 beats behind where I'm even able to play at.  If I were to play at the music's speed, I'd lose because the tiles for the notes and chords would pass the bottom of the screen because of the audio lag.  All around, that kind of ruins the experience for me - as the graphics and smooth transitions from song book to piano are amazing, and has a similar classic piano tiles 2 background but I still cannot fully enjoy this game simply because of the audio lag.  I'm going to take my best guess as to why the audio lag is an issue in this app, as you [the makers] are simply putting the song over the gameplay instead of programming notes and chords to play when a tile is tapped.  Now, I don't recall having this issue in any of the past apps, but it's certainly a turn off and leads me away from your piano tiles applications.  Thank you.</td>

Second, on some songs the sound is not up to the beat, as for example in the beginners challenge it is way off and i solidly go off of my vision. Overall I like this game, but those things needs to be improved. Thank you for reading this and take this in consideration.</td>
