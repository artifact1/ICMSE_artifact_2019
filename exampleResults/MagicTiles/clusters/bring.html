<td>Awesome doesn't begin to describe this game. It is mind-blowing. Without a doubt the best put together black tiles game out there. It took me a little bit to get to like the new graphics because I learned on the old one. But I have definitely accepted them and really love the <mark>colors</mark> they are truly beautiful to see. Come see why millions of people all over the world love this game. Enjoy yourself while you challenge other players from all over the world and meet new friends along the way. That is probably one of its best features. But you also have Lively upbeat music. Beautiful arranged scores in the highest quality piano + instrumental music of any game like this. This game is very well-thought-out. Very well-planned and very well orchestrated. It's a joy to play. I can't think of any other game I like playing more. I honestly can say without a doubt I love this game and I know I'm not alone. So come on be apart of something truly wonderful to learn to play. You will get lost in the music and spend hours learning just like I did and loving every minute. How do you give 10 Stars when there are only 5? You guys deserve it. Way to go.</td>

<td>The game could be good unfortunately due to the fact that the developers operate their ad Revenue like an AIDS Factory it's almost impossible to play the game. In <mark>addition</mark> to the game having advertisements display in the middle of a game costing you a life a lot of the advertisements take you to random web pages that tell you your phone is infected.  If the developer such as this does not know how to properly use ads and know to wean out and Screen those who potentially place viruses on people's phones then this game should be avoided at all cost do not install this game it is the equivalent of waking up and sleeping with a prostitute asking for AIDS</td>

And the data of each song unlocked is not yet downloaded. Must have an internet connection to download. Can you just put those data once?

It makes it more interesting(only that the perfect line is too low) it is also very convenient that the hearts refill very fast. Thank you for these features.</td>

<td>Alright developers, first thing is that input sometimes does not read and the tile goes right by (my screen is clean, and it is annoying to see that my best score in beginners challenge is 4441 and the top world is 4628 and i did not get there because my tap did not read right at the beginning of the song). Second, on some songs the sound is not up to the beat, as for example in the beginners challenge it is way off and i solidly go off of my vision. Overall I like this game, but those things needs to be <mark>improved</mark>. Thank you for reading this and take this in consideration.</td>
