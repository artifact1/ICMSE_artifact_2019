<td><mark>Awesome doesn't begin to describe this game. It is mind-blowing. Without a doubt the best put together black tiles game out there</mark>. It took me a little bit to get to like the new graphics because I learned on the old one. But I have definitely accepted them and really love the colors they are truly beautiful to see. Come see why millions of people all over the world love this game. Enjoy yourself while you challenge other players from all over the world and meet new friends along the way. That is probably one of its best features. But you also have Lively upbeat music. Beautiful arranged scores in the highest quality piano + instrumental music of any game like this. This game is very well-thought-out. Very well-planned and very well orchestrated. It's a joy to play. I can't think of any other game I like playing more. I honestly can say without a doubt I love this game and I know I'm not alone. So come on be apart of something truly wonderful to learn to play. You will get lost in the music and spend hours learning just like I did and loving every minute. How do you give 10 Stars when there are only 5? You guys deserve it. Way to go.</td>

<td>The game could be good unfortunately due to the fact that the developers operate their ad Revenue like an AIDS Factory it's almost impossible to play the game. In addition to the game having advertisements display in the middle of a game costing you a life a lot of the advertisements take you to random web pages that tell you your phone is infected.  If the developer such as this does not know how to properly use ads and know to wean out and Screen those who potentially place viruses on <mark>people's</mark> phones then this game should be avoided at all cost do not install this game it is the equivalent of waking up and sleeping with a prostitute asking for AIDS</td>

Songs just speed up instead of offering any unique difficulty to tile layouts. The game doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment because there</mark> is no completing a certain difficulty, it can always go faster and you will eventually miss a single note. If you are looking to install this game to introduce yourself to rhythm gaming, please skip it. There is a lot more to offer in the genre than this piano tile experience.</td>

<td>The music must be within the tiles. If you tap it, the music is within it to make it fully alive. It's kind of useless if you tap it with just having a background sound. Kind of boring. And the data of each song unlocked is not yet downloaded. Must have an internet connection to download. Can you just <mark>put</mark> those data once? Even though its size is huge atleast all songs were ready when bought/unlocked. By the way, I love the songs. Can't resist from it. I hope this suggestion will help your app improves a lot.</td>

It would be great if they have matching players to compete instead of having different player with too much different skill level. Also, there is no 2nd place for some reason. Two 1st and then 3rd and 4th place. Being able to add the players who is not your facebook friend in the game would be awesome as well.</td>

Keep it up! Keep making great music! The only thing that bothers</mark> me is the abrupt ending with audience applause everytime I finish a song and some lags when I hit a tile beyond the line. I hope you fix it soon. Nevertheless, I love this game! Also I think this games requires a powerful device to truly enjoy it.</td>

The only thing I would say I don't like is some of the songs are really quite so I have to turn up my volume, that causes another</mark> problem, when I miss a tile the note that's played when you get it wrong is very loud. That's all, love the game.</td>

<td>Overall the game is meh. The background is cancerous to the eyes, it hurts to look at for too long. The detection system is inaccurate, but not to the point of absolute trash, but still very frustrating. When you tapped the notes, it didn't feel in sync with the music playing in the background which is crucial because the notes are supposed to come <mark>put</mark> according to the music and if it doesn't the chances of messing up increases by quite a bit (at least for me). Basically I'm saying that the idea is ok/subpar, but the execution was terrible</td>

<td><mark>I've been following the whole piano tile craze for a while, and these ones I've enjoyed the most.  Although this app is kind of a bummer for me as a musician and comparing it to piano tiles 2.  No matter how low on the screen I tap the tiles while playing, the music is always lagging, at least 2 beats behind where</mark> I'm even able to play at.  If I were to play at the music's speed, I'd lose because the tiles for the notes and chords would pass the bottom of the screen because of the audio lag.  All around, that kind of ruins the experience for me - as the graphics and smooth transitions from song book to piano are amazing, and has a similar classic piano tiles 2 background but I still cannot fully enjoy this game simply because of the audio lag.  I'm going to take my best guess as to why the audio lag is an issue in this app, as you [the makers] are simply putting the song over the gameplay instead of programming notes and chords to play when a tile is tapped.  Now, I don't recall having this issue in any of the past apps, but it's certainly a turn off and leads me away from your piano tiles applications.  Thank you.</td>
