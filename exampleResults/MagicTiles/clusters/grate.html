<td>Awesome doesn't begin to describe this game. It is mind-blowing. Without a doubt the best put together black tiles game out there. It took me a little bit to get to like the new graphics because I learned on the old one. But I have definitely accepted them and really love the colors they are truly beautiful to see. Come see why millions of people all over the world love this game. <mark>Enjoy</mark> yourself while you challenge other players from all over the world and meet new friends along the way. That is probably one of its best features. But you also have Lively upbeat music. Beautiful arranged scores in the highest quality piano + instrumental music of any game like this. This game is very well-thought-out. Very well-planned and very well orchestrated. It's a joy to play. I can't think of any other game I like playing more. I honestly can say without a doubt I love this game and I know I'm not alone. So come on be apart of something truly wonderful to learn to play. You will get lost in the music and spend hours learning just like I did and loving every minute. How do you give 10 Stars when there are only 5? You guys deserve it. Way to go.</td>

<td>Don't know why this could be considered a rhythm game. The music does not line up with the tiles very well, yet the tiles are so large that it barely matters when you hit them. Songs just speed up instead of offering any unique difficulty to tile layouts. The game doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment because there is no completing a certain difficulty, it can always go faster and you will eventually miss a single note. If you are looking to install this game to introduce yourself to rhythm gaming, please skip it. There is a lot more to offer in the genre than this piano tile <mark>experience</mark>.</td>

<td>It is fun BUT the game is not sensitive enough when I tap sometimes it does not respond I don't have this problem with piano tiles two or something And sometimes when we are battling or something the tiles suddenly stop for a split second and when it starts again I missed the tiles already and I lose even though I have the <mark>chance</mark> of winning  This is the only game I gave three stars to so please fix it  The good thing about this game is that this game as it has a very unique feature of a multi player mode and I like it. It makes it more interesting(only that the perfect line is too low) it is also very convenient that the hearts refill very fast. Thank you for these features.</td>

<td>Overall the game is meh. The background is cancerous to the eyes, it hurts to look at for too long. The detection system is inaccurate, but not to the point of absolute trash, but still very frustrating. When you tapped the notes, it didn't feel in sync with the music playing in the background which is crucial because the notes are supposed to come put according to the music and if it doesn't the <mark>chances</mark> of messing up increases by quite a bit (at least for me). Basically I'm saying that the idea is ok/subpar, but the execution was terrible</td>

<td>I've been following the whole piano tile craze for a while, and these ones I've <mark>enjoyed</mark> the most.  Although this app is kind of a bummer for me as a musician and comparing it to piano tiles 2.  No matter how low on the screen I tap the tiles while playing, the music is always lagging, at least 2 beats behind where I'm even able to play at.  If I were to play at the music's speed, I'd lose because the tiles for the notes and chords would pass the bottom of the screen because of the audio lag.  All around, that kind of ruins the experience for me - as the graphics and smooth transitions from song book to piano are amazing, and has a similar classic piano tiles 2 background but I still cannot fully enjoy this game simply because of the audio lag.  I'm going to take my best guess as to why the audio lag is an issue in this app, as you [the makers] are simply putting the song over the gameplay instead of programming notes and chords to play when a tile is tapped.  Now, I don't recall having this issue in any of the past apps, but it's certainly a turn off and leads me away from your piano tiles applications.  Thank you.</td>

<td>The gameplay and <mark>graphics</mark> are super smooth, however, my only complaint is that if you are using a Samsung device with edge panels, sometimes you can tap the panel and not the tile causing you to lose.

<td>Alright developers, first thing is that input sometimes does not read and the tile goes right by (my screen is clean, and it is annoying to see that my best score in beginners challenge is 4441 and the top world is 4628 and i did not get there because my tap did not read right at the beginning of the song). Second, on some songs the sound is not up to the <mark>beat</mark>, as for example in the beginners challenge it is way off and i solidly go off of my vision.
