<td>Awesome doesn't begin to describe this game. It is mind-blowing. Without a doubt the best put together black tiles game out there. It took me a little bit to get to like the new graphics because I learned on the old one. But I have definitely accepted them and really love the colors they are truly beautiful to see. Come see why millions of people all over the world love this game. Enjoy yourself while you challenge other players from all over the world and meet new friends along the way. That is probably one of its best features. But you also have Lively upbeat music. Beautiful arranged scores in the highest quality piano + instrumental music of any game like this. This game is very well-thought-out. Very well-planned and very well orchestrated. It's a joy to play. I can't think of any other game I like playing more. I honestly can say without a doubt I love this game and I know I'm not alone. So come on be apart of something truly wonderful to learn to play. You will get lost in the music and spend hours learning just like I did and loving every minute. How do you give 10 Stars when there are only 5? You guys <mark>deserve</mark> it. Way to go.</td>

I guess I can destroy things other than my flight of the bumblebee score" but randomly for no reason tiles can't be tapped -_- do you have any idea how annoying it is to redo skilled over and over because you literally can't tap a tile? Even skilled here is to easy but that bull glitch is pushing a lower rate than you guys <mark>deserve</mark>. Update: gonna uninstall this garbage until this gets fixed, let me know when you get around to not producing terrible knockoffs</td>

Also other types of music (rock, rap, pop, country, ect.). Get the soul moving and the star ratings will jump.
